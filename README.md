Hi, Iâ€™m Jennifer! I am currently a fourth year Computer Science major (with a specialization in information technology) at the University of California, Irvine. 
I'm interested in getting into development operations post college, and love the connection between coding and network systems.
Outside of school, I can be found working as a technology consultant for the Paul Merage Business School, and as a coding instructor at Coding Minds Academy.
Listed on my page are a few projects I have gotten the chance to complete, and a few incomplete, that I am always looking to improve as my skills are improved!
